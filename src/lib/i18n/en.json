      "fullText": "On Simeulue Island, long before modern early warning systems existed, our ancestors passed down a poem, a song called 'Smong'. This poem was not just a chant, but a guide to life. 'Enggel mon sao suru, linon bak, mae oek suruik...' which means 'If a strong earthquake is followed by the receding of the sea, run immediately to high ground'. When the devastating earthquake and tsunami struck Aceh in 2004, it was the memory of Smong that prompted us all to run to the hills, away from the coast. Of the tens of thousands of residents, only a few became victims. Smong is proof that nature gives signs, and our ancestors taught us how to read them. This is a story of how knowledge passed down from generation to generation became our savior."

Then, we remembered the stories of our elders, that the mangrove forest was our natural fortress. Together, the youth and the elderly, we began to replant mangrove seedlings along the coast. It was difficult at first, many failed. But we did not give up. Now, after many years, the mangrove forest has grown dense. Its strong roots grip the soil, holding back the waves. Our village is now safer. Children can play on the beach without fear. The mangrove forest not only protects us, but also becomes a home for fish and crabs, providing us with an additional source of livelihood."

Then, some of us, the mothers, thought: everyone needs to eat, and food can unite. We set up a simple community kitchen. Anyone could come to eat, and anyone could help cook. This is where the magic happened. While cutting vegetables and stirring curry, we began to talk. We shared stories, laughter, and tears. The walls that once separated us slowly crumbled. This kitchen became more than just a place to eat; it became a space for reconciliation. We learned that peace can start from the simplest thing: a plate of warm rice and an open heart."

To face this, we revived the tradition of a 'communal barn'. Every family with a surplus harvest would set aside a portion of their yield to be stored in the communal barn. When a family experienced hardship or crop failure, they could take from this barn. There is no interest, no debt record. Everything is based on the spirit of mutual cooperation and care. This barn is a symbol of our unity. It teaches us that by sharing, we all become stronger. We may not be rich in material things, but we are rich in brotherhood."

      "fullText": "That night, March 10, 2011, the sky seemed to break over Tangse. The rain that fell was no longer just rain, but like water being poured from the sky without stopping. Those of us living along the Krueng Tangse were used to the river rising, but that night was different. Around midnight, we heard a rumbling sound that was not from thunder. The sound grew louder, like a collapsing mountain. Some of us who were curious tried to look outside. What we saw was a horrifying scene: the river water was overflowing wildly, its color pitch black, and carrying with it dozens of giant logs that collided with each other. It wasn't an ordinary flood, it was 'Bah' – a raging flood.\\n\\nThe village head shouted through the mosque's loudspeaker, 'The water is rising! Save yourselves! Run to high ground!' The electricity went out, making the atmosphere even more panicked and tense. In the pitch dark, we could only rely on instinct. The sound of giant logs hitting bridges and houses sounded so close. Even the wooden stilt houses were powerless, uprooted from their foundations and swept away by the current. We ran as fast as we could to the hills, to higher ground, with only the clothes on our backs. From the top of the hill, we watched our village being devoured by the ferocious flood. In the morning, as the water began to recede, all that was left was thick mud and debris. The main bridge was broken, dozens of houses were gone, and our rice fields had turned into a sea of mud. We realized, this was not just a natural disaster. This was the result of greed. The forest upstream that should have been a buffer had been stripped bare by illegal logging. The river no longer had a barrier. Bah Tangse became the bitterest lesson for us, that destroying nature is the same as destroying ourselves. Since then, we have vowed to protect our forests, to replant trees, as a legacy so that a similar tragedy does not happen again."

We formed a 'Fire-Care Community' group. We patrol voluntarily, create firebreaks, and most importantly, educate residents not to clear land by burning. This is not the government's job, this is our shared responsibility. This forest is our water source, home to wildlife, and a legacy for our children and grandchildren. Extinguishing the fire before it grows is our way of building peace with nature."

Starting again from scratch was very hard. But, we saw hope in these coffee beans. We worked hard, learned better farming techniques, and built a cooperative together. Slowly but surely, Gayo coffee became known to the world. The aroma of the coffee we process every morning is not just the aroma of a drink, but also the aroma of peace and hard work. These coffee plantations have reunited us, provided jobs, and allowed us to send our children to school. Coffee has healed our wounds."

We decided to revive the Seudati dance troupe. This dance is not just about movement, it also teaches discipline, teamwork, and contains advisory poems. It wasn't easy to attract their interest at first. But with patience, our troupe began to grow. Their energy is now channeled into preserving culture. Through dance, we build bridges between villages and create a safe space for young people to express themselves positively."

Slowly, our products began to be known. Orders came in, and we earned our own income. We are no longer just victims, we are empowered survivors. This group became our new family, a place where we weave back hope for the future."

The architecture of our ancestors is truly extraordinary. The stilt house with its flexible wooden construction is able to absorb earthquake shocks. The space underneath the house not only serves as a multipurpose area but also provides a path for water in case of floods or inundation. We began to advocate for and rebuild houses by adapting the principles of Rumoh Aceh. This is not about returning to the past, but taking the best lessons from the past to build a safer future."

We started painting murals on public walls. Not to erase the memory, but to give it new color. We painted about hope, resilience, togetherness, and the beauty of Aceh. This process of painting together became therapy for us and the community. Children joined in. The once gloomy walls have now become an open gallery that tells the story of our revival.

This knowledge is not in books, it is passed down from father to son, from one generation of fishermen to the next. This is the science of life that allows us to be friends with the ocean."

Miraculously, at the bottom, there was still clear water that never ran out! It turned out, our ancestors built the well right on top of a large spring. That old well saved our village. We learned that modern technology is not always better. There is wisdom in the relics of the past that we must preserve."

Siaga immediately dropped to the ground, took cover under a sturdy table, and held on to its leg. His friends, who were initially scared and confused, saw what Siaga was doing and immediately followed suit. After the shaking stopped, Siaga calmly led his friends to an open field, away from buildings and tall trees. 'We have to go to a high place, just in case the sea water recedes,' he said, remembering the Smong story he had heard. Siaga's story teaches children that by knowing what to do, we don't need to panic when a disaster strikes. We can protect ourselves and our friends."

Along the way, he saw other residents also guiding children and assisting the elderly. The village officials sounded the siren, giving directions, and everyone followed in an orderly manner. That night, at the evacuation site, they sat together sharing food and stories, calming those who were frightened. When dawn came and Mount Aruna was calm again, Rafi saw his village was still intact, although covered in ash. He smiled with relief—they were all safe because they were prepared. From that day on, Rafi understood that disaster mitigation is not just about knowing the theory, but about caring, cooperation, and readiness to protect oneself and others before danger arrives."
