- EduBoard Asset Access: Provide a dedicated page for downloading high-resolution EduBoard posters and accessing usage guides.
- Generative Media Display: The main way to browse/consume content will involve AI generated assets based on original content (text). Users can watch videos, read comics, or interact with a gamified quiz. AI acts as a tool to translate/generate these artifacts based on source content.
